# NotepadX
A cross platform text editor

## Background and Motivation
In today's software development landscape, there's a clear need for a truly lightweight, fast, and cross-platform text editor that combines efficiency with intuitive design. While numerous editors exist, many either sacrifice performance for features or simplicity for cross-platform compatibility.

NotepadX fills this gap with a clean, responsive editor that feels native on Windows, macOS, and Linux alike. It offers the perfect balance between functionality and resource efficiency—providing the essential features developers need without the bloat that slows down workflow.

This project embodies the philosophy that great tools should be simple, responsive, and accessible to everyone regardless of their operating system. Built with C++ and Qt, NotepadX delivers a modern, portable, and fully open-source editing experience. Our goal isn't to replace full-featured IDEs, but to provide a lightning-fast editor that supports syntax highlighting, multiple tabs, and powerful search capabilities—all while maintaining minimal memory and disk footprint. NotepadX represents a commitment to quality software that respects both your system resources and your productivity.
